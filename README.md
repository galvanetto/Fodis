# Getting Fodis

## Installation Requirements

...



## Download



To start the software, simply double-click the file named pride-inspector-X.Y.jar. If this fails, try to download and install Java 1.7 or above, as explained in the previous section. (The program can also be started from the command line using the following command: java -jar pride-inspector-X.Y.jar.)

The zip file contains also an examples folder with 2 sample files: one in mzML format (mzml-example.mzML) and the other in PRIDE xml format (pride-example.xml) so you can upload them in pride inspector and try the application. There is and additional folder, config, that contains a file called config.props where you can modify the amount of memory assigned to your application (only change if you are trying to view files and is causing the software crash because of a "Out of memory..." exception). The additional 2 directories, lib and log, contain all the java libraries necessary for the application to run and some debugging information if the application crashes.

## Mac OS X App Gatekeeper Message

If a user downloads the PRIDE Inspector software onto Mac OS X 10.8, they will see a scary warning:

<quote>"PRIDE Inspecor can’t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer"</quote>

![Mac Error](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PRIDE-Toolsuite/pride-inspector/master/wiki/mac_error.png)

<string>Solution</strong>

1- Solution 1: To override your security settings and open the app anyway:


    - In the Finder, locate the app you want to open. Don’t use Launchpad to do this. Launchpad doesn’t allow you to access the shortcut menu.

    - Press the Control key, then click the app icon.
 
    - Choose Open from the shortcut menu.

    - Click Open.

The app is saved as an exception to your security settings, and you will be able to open it in the future by double-clicking it, just like any registered app.

2- Solution 2: Permanet solution

  To run unsigned software you need to go into Mac OS X Preferences>Security & Privacy>General and change Allow applications downloaded from Mac App store and identified developers to Anywhere:
