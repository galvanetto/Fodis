Open Fodis_Linux folder

Run as administrator the Web installer: sudo ./MyAppInstaller_web.install
It will download a free version of the MATLAB_RUNTIME necessary to run Fodis. 
It will take few minutes to download and ~255 MB of free space

Now run "./run_Fodis.sh < MCR Folder>"
where <MCR Folder> is the path where you installed the MCR. 
Usually is something like /MATLAB/MATLAB_Runtime/v90/
